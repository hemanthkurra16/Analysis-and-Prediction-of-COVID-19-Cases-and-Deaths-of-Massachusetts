Goals of the Project
The primary goal of this project is to analyze COVID-19 data to understand the factors influencing the number of confirmed cases and deaths during the pandemic. By utilizing various statistical and machine learning methods, we aim to identify significant predictors of COVID-19 mortality and provide insights into the effectiveness of different interventions and policies.
Research Questions
1.	What are the significant predictors of COVID-19 mortality?
2.	How do factors like age, gender, and ethnicity influence COVID-19 case and death rates?
3.	What policy measures can be suggested to reduce mortality rates during a pandemic?
Methods Used
To address these questions, we used the following methods:
1.	Descriptive Statistics: To provide an overview of the dataset and summary statistics by groups (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity).
2.	Linear Regression and LASSO Regression: To identify significant predictors of COVID-19 cases and deaths.
3.	Time Series Analysis: To forecast future COVID-19 cases using ARIMA models.
